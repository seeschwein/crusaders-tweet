chasing european rightwingers on twitter

it came to my attention twitter has a sprawling community of anti-migrant europeans in a weird "pan£$€european" movement which uses the eu stars flag emoji.

i will use beautiful soup to count how many of them there are based on the EU flag emoji use in bios. the challenge will be telling which accounts are bigots and which ones are actual EU officials or non-bigots

some network analysis with a database would also be fun to implement
